    <p>
      FollowAlong is a website that knows how to get new content from the people and things you care about.
      <strong>Most importantly, all of your data stays <em>right here</em> &mdash; in <em>this</em> browser (we don't collect analytics and offer an optional you-to-you encrypted "syncing" server for multi-device support).</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      FollowAlong uses RSS, which means you can follow YouTube channels, Blogs, Calendars, Podcast, team activities, and much more.
      We've added some content to let you see how it feels to use FollowAlong.
      <!-- <em>It's just you here</em> &mdash; nobody is listening in (check the Developer tools if you don't believe me). -->
      <!-- Eventually, you can enter an RSS/Atom feed URL in the "Search" bar above to follow others from YouTube, Twitter, etc. -->
    </p>

    <h2>What's different about FollowAlong?</h2>

    <p>
      Until now, social networks stored everyone's data in ONE central place.
      This meant that your personal information &mdash; what you like and share, who you follow, who you donate to &mdash; gets saved on a server somewhere that's out of your hands.
      In turn, that SINGLE company controls what you see &mdash; news, content, articles, recommendations &mdash; and how you see it.
      To make matters worse, the company sells your data to anyone who'll buy.
      If this bugs you... read on.
    </p>

    <p>
      FollowAlong decentralizes the paradigm.
      Once you choose which feeds to follow, your own device becomes your server, storage, and internet connection.
      It regularly checks for fresh content, which is stored it on your device.
      <span class="highlight">As a result, your content comes <em>directly</em> from the source with no virtually censorship and no manipulation &mdash; just freedom.</span>
      There are no ads, trackers, or any other shenanigans on FollowAlong.
    </p>

    <p>
      As an added bonus, we have "Services". They can do things like provide a VPN-proxy for every request to your feeds, store your data in an S3 file, and much more coming soon.
    </p>

    <!-- If you choose, you can sync it (encrypted end-to-end) to other devices. -->
    <!-- <p>
        By decentralizing with end-to-end local, interactions become more honest, more truthful, and more personal.
        Intentions and incentives such  View counts, likes, and downvotes disappear.
      </p> -->

    <h2>How can others follow <em>YOU</em>?</h2>

    <p>
      Just like email, you can choose your own "hosting provider" or host your own RSS feed.
      You may even have one already on your website!
      People can follow ANY existing RSS feed (WordPress, YouTube, Joomla, Drupal, Podcast platform, Intranets, Event Calendars, make your own, etc).
      We'd recommend that you use your website as the main feed to publicize as it has the smallest chance of being restricted.
    </p>

    <h2>The Tech Specs</h2>

    <p>
      The goal of FollowAlong is an end-to-end encrypted "social" network.
      Under the hood, it's just a little HTML, VueJS, and CSS that works together to fetch RSS feeds.
      You can use FollowAlong here at {{ domain }}.
      To see the source code, visit <a
        href="https://github.com/followalong/followalong"
        target="_blank"
        class="link"
      >GitHub</a>.
      You can even host your own anywhere you like (even locally).
      Data is stored via LocalForage (IndexedDB, LocalStorage, etc) on your own device &mdash; and never sends any data anywhere other than the feeds you follow.
      Only the feeds you follow know that you're following them.
      At any time, you can download a JSON file of your data in <router-link
        to="/settings"
        class="link"
      >
        Settings
      </router-link>.
    </p>

    <h3>A Small Caveat</h3>

    <p>
      Cross-Origin domain issues occur trying fetch items from other domains.
      By default, we set the Proxy to a passthrough server so you can grab content from YouTube and other popular sites (we don't record any data).
      Don't trust us? Good. Set your own "Passthrough Proxy" server in <router-link
        to="/settings"
        class="link"
      >
        Settings
      </router-link>.
      We think CORS on RSS feeds is silly &mdash; hopefully it will become the standard to NOT have it.
      We can easily integrate authorized feeds and create a new paradigm of pay-for-access feeds.
    </p>

    <h2>
      What are the drawbacks?
      <a
        v-if="!showDrawbacks"
        href="javascript:;"
        class="link"
        @click="showDrawbacks = true"
      >Just a handful...</a>
    </h2>

    <div v-if="showDrawbacks">
      <p>
        From where we sit, there are a handful of drawbacks right now, but they can all be solved quickly with quick, effective development.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Not-So-Live Data and Bandwidth.</strong>
        Your browser searches for new info from everyone you follow when you load the page, every 15 minutes.
        You can also fetch manually.
        Also, the publishing server can specify ETAGs, support delta queries, and implement caching.
        Regardless, isn't the privacy worth a little more bandwidth?
        Ultimately, the bandwidth isn't <em>that</em> much more.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Discover-ability (for now).</strong>
        This is a very important space to figure out because it is how the "network" grows.
        We're working on it &mdash; perhaps RSS feeds can set others "endorsed" feeds?
        On the flipside, once you gain a follower on FollowAlong, you are directly connected to them, so you don't have to worry about silly algorithms not notifying people of your updates.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Verify-ability.</strong>
        How do we verify that you are who you say you are?
        There are a few ways we can do this.
        We'll get into the nitty-gritty when we start building the publishing tools.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Comment-ability.</strong>
        We're looking into supporting the major players such as Discourse, WordPress, and others.
        More to come soon.

    <h2>
      How do I use FollowAlong on another device?
    </h2>

    <p>
      Right now, you can't "sync" between devices, but you can follow the same things.
      Visit the <router-link
        to="/settings"
        class="link"
      >
        Settings
      </router-link> page and copy your "Config" file.
      On your other device, visit the <router-link
        to="/settings"
        class="link"
      >
        Settings
      </router-link> page and paste in the config file â€“ that's it!
    </p>
