## Ads

The power of curation must be in the hands of the Feed. If things go bad, they can just change providers. They can also just supply their own.

An "Ad Provider" is in charge of showing ads.

An "Ad Provider" could be the feed itself OR outsourced â€“ its just a link.

The publisher can define at the `Item` level:

```xml
<Item>
  <Ad format="skyscraper" src="https://example.com/my-feed/ad.jpg" href="httsp://example.com">
</Item>
```

Another, more complicated option would be to add it at the `Feed` level:

```xml
<Feed>
  <AdProvider url="https://example.com/my-feed">
</Feed>
```
